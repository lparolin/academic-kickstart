# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "An electric power system includes a generating unit, which includes a controller for controlling an operational mode of the generating unit. The electric power system also includes an event estimator communicatively coupled to the controller of the generating unit and a network estimator communicatively coupled to the event estimator. The network estimator includes a processor configured to receive status information associated with the electric power system, determine, based upon the status information, at least one characteristic of the electric power system, and transmit the at least one characteristic to the event estimator."
